title: An unusually perfect Monday
category: post
---

Mondays can be horrible. I think most, if not all of us, know that. They are
usually that horrible segfault in our brain when we have to snap out of the
coziness of being at ease on the weekend to go back to our work. To put it
simply, Mondays usually suck harder than a black hole in a vacuum.

Fortunately, mine did not. Not today.

It actually didn't even start today. Last night was the first Sunday in months
where I actually slept properly. Not even that, I slept like a king. Which
I don't think I should have, because the night between Saturday and Sunday
I had a lot of sleep paralysis seizures. Four or more (I can't really tell),
which is by far the worst I've had. Still, Sunday was alright for some reason,
andI fell asleep pretty much as I laid my fine self in my bed. This morning,
I woke up rested and with a smile on my face fifteen minutes before my alarm.

So, I woke up, ate a nice breakfast, had a nice shower with no stress, shaved,
and even did my hair so I looked extra gorg. On the train, I did my
[self-imposed language homework][duolingo], and I nailed it. Then I got to
work, which is where the awesome really starts.

So, Spotify has something called Hack Days. You pretty much get one Hack Day
every two weeks or so, and on a Hack Day you can hack on whatever you want
regardless if it relates to your usual duties or not. This week, Spotify has
amped that up to eleven with the **Hack Week**. During the Hack Week, the
entire company has Hack Days, for a week. And not only us cool and sexy
developers, but all the business people and legal people and everyone else as
well. Everyone gets together to create something outside of what we usually do.

I've been working on [kitten][kitten]. It's a dear project of mine that I have
had since the summer, hacking on every now and then. Today, I got to sit down
for more than eight concentrated hours (I left work after three hours overtime
&lt;3). This was extra awesome, because that time let me focus enough so that
I ironed out a lot of stuff that was just question marks before. And that
feeling is one of the best developer-related feelings there are.

To top it all of, my colleague gave me a sticker. I think it's the best sticker
I've seen in my entire life.

I mean, look at this motherfucker. **Look at him**! Isn't he the best sticker
representation of me of all time? He is even surrounded by what is basically my
catchphrase, *Hehe*. To top that off, he also looks like a devious little shit
who is just about to fuck something up. Ah, he made my already glorious day
just a little bit more shiny. Shout out to *mango* for giving me this gift of
Hehe.

In slightly related news, [a Wikipedia article][hehe] that I wind up on way to
often when trying to figure out if I have internet connectivity or not. It
always makes me giggle.

So, I'm not sure why, but I am very thankful for having my first good Monday in
what feels like a small forever. I needed that, and I hope the rest of you have
had at least a bearable day today. You deserve it. &lt;3
