title: The Scales of Estimation
category: computer discussion
---

Developers create things.  Most people know that.  What only developers (and by
extension, the people who manage developers) know is that developing is
a constant struggle against the Scales of Estimation.

Let me elaborate: whatever the current task is, a developer always has to ask
herself; "What do I need to do and how much time will it cost me to do it
properly?".  _Properly_ is the keyword there.  For any given task there are
very different levels of _done_.  You might solve a problem by the equivalent
of using duct tape to make sure something doesn't catch fire, but if you do so
the duct tape will probably instead start leaking water after a while.  Quick
solutions are just that, and it's only rarely that they don't cause other more
severe problems down the road.

The problem is of course; who has the time to do _everything_ properly when there
are a thousand pressing tasks to be done?

(sadly, that _"everything"_ is often more in lieu with _"anything"_)

Coming from the startup world, I've been beating around this quite a lot.  The
entire software development community is currently obsessed with the
[agile][agile] trend, and the world of startups is almost doubly so.  And for
good reason; for startups every day is a battle of sink and swim.  If the
developers don't churn everything out at maximum pace, the ship will most
certainly sink.

Of course, time is not the only factor.  Everything needs to be perfect,
stable, tested, documented and scalable as well. As the saying goes:
["Fast. Good. Cheap. Choose two."][pmt]

Luckily, as with most things in this world, these are not absolutes. This is
where the skill of the Scales of Estimation come in.  Whenever we developers do
something, we can balance between doing something quickly and cheaply or doing
it properly and sturdy.

I can honestly say that this skill is the one I try to hone the most.  It is
one of the ones I value most as a developer, and simultaneously the one I'm
probably the worst at. It's just very difficult to do it right, most probably
because every situation and every task need their own estimation and because so
many external factors may or may not affect the decision and the outcome.

I just always try to remember:

_"Whenever you do a quick fix, you're just borrowing time from your future
self."_
