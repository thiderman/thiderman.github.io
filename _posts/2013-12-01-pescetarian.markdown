title: A month without meat
category: post personal
---

I've stopped eating meat. Since my 25th birthday, I am a pescetarian;
a vegetarian that eats seafood. This past month has been great, and I have
decided to keep this up!

I did this switch because of a couple of reasons. To sum them up:

* Vegetarian dishes usually taste amazeballs better than other dishes because
  the taste is not focused on the meat. Some of my favorite things even before
  this decision are vegetarian anyway.
* I usually feel better when I don't eat meat. Especially pork-based dishes
  make me feel pretty bad in general. It's kind of like a bad food coma, but in
  a different way.
* I like the thought of a guided cuisine. Making me think about what I decide
  to eat usually leads me to eat better.
* ...and I wanted to see if I can do it, which it seems that I can. :D

So, it's more about the effect what I eat have on me rather than, well,
politics. I don't think I have found any real negative parts either. At
restaurants the selection has slimmed down a lot, but pretty much all places
have fish, and some even have vegetarian stuff outright.

I am also pragmatic about it; if I am visiting someone and they offer
me food, I will not alter it or leave parts out just because it is meat-based.
There is also risk for the occasional hangover-bacon in the future, even
though that has not happened yet. :&gt;

This past month I have not done much new cooking for myself, but I am going to
do more of that this coming winter month. If you're used to this type of
cuisine and have a few tips, please holler and I would be very happi hoers!

In unrelated news, I played some actual drums today for the first time in
years! I jammed with my cousins band, and it felt awesome!

Lastly, in related news, my sushi consumption is currently through the roof,
haha. 'tis good times. &lt;3
