title: A Python standard library for modern times
category: post computer python
---

A standard library can make or break a new language. The first few moments
wanting to write something just a few bytes more complex than a **hello
world** in a new language are crucial. This side of the millennium a developer
will have expectations on what a language should offer from the get-go.

But what about when time passes and developers start to get fed up with the
quirks and errors and start to write their own new and shinier solutions to
the problems addressed by the standard library of their language? What effects
will that have on the standard library, and how will that affect future users?

This is a discussion about standard libraries. Since I primarily develop in
Python, that's the language I will discuss in depth. The points I raise might
or might not hold true for other languages, but I strive to have them be food
for thought in a language agnostic manner.

## So what's a standard library?

Before we can dig further, there should be some kind of definition on what a
standard library is. I have been thinking of the concept as having several layers:

### Level 0 - The language itself

This is the absolute necessities, and things that a developer would not have
to `import` or `include` to be able to use - the ability to set variables,
define functions and create classes.

This feels obvious, but is important for the discussion. If the standard
library is the API for the language, these things are the lowest common
denominator.

### Level 1 - Building blocks

These are the things a developer would `import` or `include`. This is usually
simple but well defined libraries for doing math, handling dates and times,
handling character encodings, and operating system interfaces. If not included
in Level 0, data structures such as lists or hash tables can be included here.

Any language worth it's salt will have these, and this is also where most
languages land should you benchmark them against these levels.

### Level 2 - Application level modules

These are userland packages, and they are for higher level things such as web
servers, template processors, database drivers, and frameworks. This is where
the bulk of libraries will be, and they are usually found in package indexes
hosted by the language operators and developers.

Most languages won't include these things in their standard library, but
rather rely on the community to provide them into the ecosystem of the
language. Interestingly enough, Python delves quite deep into this level, with
the famous "[batteries included][batteries]" approach.

## What's the state in Python?

I spent some time today going through the [Python standard library][index]
today. There are a lot of things in there, and even though I've been a Python
developer for six years I'd be lying if I told you that I knew of most of them
before today

* datetime - [arrow][arrow]
* json - [demjson][demjson]
* unittest - [py.test][pytest]
* urllib - [requests][requests]
* logging - [logbook][logbook]
* subprocess - [sh][sh]
* argparse - [click][click]
* os.path - [path.py][pathpy]

## Your own stdlib?
Looking at how I develop my own Python project, it might actually seem that I
have *my own* little standard library
